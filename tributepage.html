        <p id="tribute-info">Charlie Chaplin was an English actor, filmmaker, and composer who became one of the most influential figures in cinema history. Born on April 16, 1889, in London, he rose to fame during the silent film era with his iconic character, **"The Tramp,"** known for his bowler hat, cane, and distinctive mustache. Chaplin's films, such as *The Kid* (1921), *City Lights* (1931), *Modern Times* (1936), and *The Great Dictator* (1940), combined comedy with deep social and political themes, making him a pioneer in storytelling. His ability to express emotions through physical comedy and silent performances made him a global sensation. Despite controversies, including political accusations that led to his exile from the U.S., Chaplin remained a celebrated artist. He received an **Honorary Academy Award** in 1972, recognizing his immense contribution to cinema. He passed away on December 25, 1977, in Switzerland, but his legacy continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences worldwide.</p>
